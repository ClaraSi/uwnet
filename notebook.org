* Things to try

** DONE time-Multiple-step objective function
   CLOSED: [2017-12-13 Wed 16:49]
   
   Use a three step objective function to fit the neural network. Work being
   done in [[orgit-log:./::multiple-step-objective][this branch]].
   
   I mainly need to make a new train_euler_step function in [[file:lib/models/torch_models.py][torch_models.py]].
