Improve the computation of Q1 and Q2, so that it is exact.

Also, dmd.py attempts to find a linear model $A$, which pushes forward the dynamics:
x^{n+1} = x^{n} A
and then estimates the matrix $B$ by $log(A)$

It is unclear whether this is better than trying to find a model $B$.
(x^{n+1} - x_{n-1})/2/dt = B x^n

I suspect that the second approach (which is the one we have been using) is actually less noisy than the first.
