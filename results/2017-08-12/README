Maximum Covariance Analysis of Q1, Q2, T, and Q

Key things to compute:
 - Q1
 - Q2
 - coarse graining

Directory structure:
./A/var.nc   - coarse graining
./A/Q1.nc
./A/Q2.nc
./Dx/A/var.nc - derivatives
./Dtime/A/var.nc
./Dz/A/var.nc

# Computing Q1

The preserved variable of the SAM model is the liquid-ice potential temperature.

s_l = T + g/cp z - Lc (qc + qr)

I just computed this using SAM output by running T + g /cp z - Lc (qn + qp).
This neglects the ice phase change.

# Computing Q2

We define Q2 as the budget residual of q_t = q_v + q_n. This does not include
precipitation.
