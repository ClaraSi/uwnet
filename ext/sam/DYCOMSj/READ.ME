Nocturnal nonprecipitating stratocumulus off the California coast during DYCOMS RF01 as set by the GCSS WG 1 
(LES case coordinator: Bjorn Stevens, UCLA)

Modified by Peter Blossey based on suggestions from Chris Bretherton.
New version (DYCOMSj) uses a uniform lapse rate of 6K/km above the
inversion and balances that with a horizontal advective tendency
above the inversion.
