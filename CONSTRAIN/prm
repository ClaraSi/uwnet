! parameters file from Steve Krueger and Andrew Lesage at Univ of Utah
! for CONSTRAIN cold air outbreak case.

!Modifications:
! - Specify cloud droplet concentration of 50/cm3 (Tomassini et al, 2017)
! - Increase ncycle_max to allow time step dt to be further divided 
!      if velocities increase as the run goes on.
! - Use iop forcings to fix issue with humidity above dynamical model domain
! - Turn on instrument simulators.
! - Create new perturb_type (= 22) that adds initial noist through boundary layer
! - Recommended to use RAD_RRTM4PBL because the model domain does not reach
!      up to the stratosphere.  That radiation code will compute radiation on
!      on a deeper atmospheric profile by patching a background sounding above
!      the dynamical model domain.

!bloss(NOTE): I realize that there did not seem to be a cloud radar
!  present during CONSTRAIN, but I thought it would be good to get used
!  to looking at the cloud radar for mixed-phase cases to understand
!  how it performs.  Let us try to simulate what CloudSat would see.

surface_cloudradar = 0 ! downward-pointing, space-based cloud radar
