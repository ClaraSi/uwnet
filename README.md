Machine learning approaches to convective parametrization
=========================================================

In this project, we will train machine learning models for deep convection
using a near-global aquaplanet cloud permitting simulation as a training
dataset. As with nearly any machine learning task, the first step is to fit a
simple linear model, which in this case is not so simple.

TODO
----

- [x] Fix the results/3.4-ndb-spectra-of-modes.ipynb to compute the actual eigenvalues of the fitted operators. Currently this notebook is incorrect.
