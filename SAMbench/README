This directory aims to automate testing of SAM by running a couple of
cases for a short time in two-dimensional domains using a wide variety
of model options (e.g., different radiation, advection or microphysics
schemes).  By automating the testing of various options, it should
hopefully be easier to figure out when something is broken.

At this point, matlab scripts are provided to plot the results,
looking mostly at timeseries.  This is certainly not comprehensive,
but it will turn up many problems.
