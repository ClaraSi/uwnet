This is an artificial sounding which is intended for testing the microphysical
and other processes in the model.  The sounding has been created by adding
excess water vapor to a sounding from a simulation of radiative-convective
equilibrium in different layers.  This excess vapor should be converted to 
liquid water and ice within a timestep or two, which allows a variety of 
microphysical processes to be touched in a run of a few timesteps.  Since
a model often runs quite slow with all debugging and checking flags turned on,
this sounding allows a lot of processes to be checked quickly.

ATTN:  !!!! THIS IS NOT A REAL ATMOSPHERIC PROFILE !!!!
